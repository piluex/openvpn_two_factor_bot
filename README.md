# Bypass google authenticator 2-factor with openVPN
Hi, fuck phones. You need expect (apt-get,pacman,emerge,etc), python, pyotp and linux. 
It should work in \*nix environments with some elbow grease. 
On Window$ you can just make the python script copy the code to the clipboard and paste when 
asked.

This is the best readme you will get. If you can't manage to make it work then I guess you'll
be manually copying numbers from your phone to your PC. Nice!
