# Bypass google authenticator 2-factor in OpenVPN
Hi, fuck phones. You need expect (apt-get,pacman,emerge,etc), python, pyotp and linux. 
It should work in \*nix environments with some elbow grease. 
On Window$ you can just make the python script copy the code to the clipboard and paste when 
asked.

This is the best readme you will get. If you can't manage to make it work then I guess you'll
be manually copying numbers from your phone to your PC. Nice!

# On getting your TOTP key

I forgot how to do that. It was something like capturing packets when you register it. The number
travels from here to there when it's added to OpenVPN. It's painfull to recover from the phone app.
